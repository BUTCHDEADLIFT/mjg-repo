    'For the last couple of days, i was imagining what it would be like to create a local mahjong club (because my shithole doesn\'t have one). i have a couple of friends that already know the game fairly well, so now it\'s a matter of buying a set, trying it out and organizing everything else would be nice to meet new people, maybe even fall in love with someone, teach them the basics and see them grow. at first i\'ll be sceptical about kids joining the club but then see the potential they have and train them. maybe these kids will get so good that we would be able to go to a tournament, and then their parents will know and it will be a big mess... or maybe a cute japanese girl student joins in and everyone will try to talk to her but i\'ll let the playing do the talking, she came here for the mahjong and i\'ll show her how good i am or maybe i\'ll find good friends for life and we\'ll talk about mahjong for ages, play together, teach people together, and we\'ll play into each other\'s hands to destroy the bigger enemy without even saying a word. we\'ll also have tea, snacks, small tournaments, rivalries, it would be so fun and great. So what do you think /mjg/ should i do it'
