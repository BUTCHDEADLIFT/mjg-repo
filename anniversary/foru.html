			<h1>Mahjong Soul Anniversary Board (/mjg/ version)</h1>
			<p style="padding: 0px 75px 75px 20px;;">Mahjong Soul cheerfully celebrates its 4th anniversary. If you stuck through this shitty tile clicking game for four years while not falling for the temptations of Frank, good for you. We gathered <i>some</i> <span style="color: #83af68">>heartfelt</span> messages from the patrons of /mjg/ to our beloved devs at Mahjong Soul. Thank you Mahjong Soul, for killing Tenhou and its soulless gameplay. True mahjong comes from emote spamming.</p>

					OMG, it's been, like, 4 years already. I remember coming from high school to join the epic battles at the /v/ rooms. But things got tough after I found out I have late onset autism. Life's been a struggle, but thank goodness for mahjong. It's always there to keep me company, and now I can use the Japanese terms too! I'm even planning to read the whole mahjong book at the repo.<br><br>
					
					Anyway, I won't be able to buy my monthly charm 'cause my landlord raised the rent again. So I'll keep being a nyagger for a while no cap.<br><br>

					I just wanted to take a moment to express my deepest gratitude for introducing me to the wonderful world of mahjong. Thanks to your client, I discovered the joy of this ancient game and, most importantly, realized that there was a superior mahjong client out there. Riichi City! It's like stepping into a luxurious mahjong palace, where the tiles are polished to perfection, the players are as sharp as the edges, and the atmosphere is so intense, it could make a bonsai tree sweat. So, thank you, Mahjong Soul, for leading me to the high-definition majesty of Riichi City.

						Four years? Congratulations. Anyway, I have this really really related story to share.<br>
I went to Zoo a while ago; you know, Zoo? Well anyways there was an insane number of people there, and I couldn't get in. Then, I looked at the banner hanging from the ceiling, and it had "150 yen off" written on it. Oh, the stupidity. Those idiots. You, don't come to Zoo just because it's 150 yen off, fool. It's only 150 yen, 1-5-0 YEN for crying out loud. There're even entire families here. Family of 4, all out for some mahjong, huh? How fucking nice. "Alright, daddy's gonna go for chinitsu." God I can't bear to watch. You people, I'll give you 150 yen if you get out of those seats.<br>
Zoo should be a bloody place. That tense atmosphere, where two guys on opposite sides of the square table can start a fight at any time, the stab-or-be-stabbed mentality, that's what's great about this place. Women and children should screw off and stay home. Anyways, I was about to start playing, and then the bastard beside me goes "chi nya!" Who in the world opens their hand nowadays, you moron? I want to ask him, "do you REALLY want to go tanyao nomi?" I want to interrogate him. I want to interrogate him for roughly an hour. Are you sure you don't just want to try saying "chinpo nya"? Coming from a Zoo veteran such as myself, the latest trend among us vets is this, dama pinfu. That's right, dama. This is the vet's way of playing.<br>
Dama means higher chance of ron. But on the other hand the value is a tad lower. This is the key. And then, it's devious. This is unbeatable. However, if you do this then there is danger that you'll be marked by the players from next time on; it's a double-edged sword. I can't recommend it to amateurs.
What this all really means, though, is that you should just stick with riichi.<br>

						What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little nyagger? I'll have you know I graduated top of my Mahjong class, and I've been involved in numerous secret tournaments against top players, and I have over 300 confirmed wins.<br>
I am trained in tile warfare and I'm the top player in the entire Mahjong Soul community. You are nothing to me but just another discarded tile.<br>
You think you can get away with dama at my table? Think again, nyagger. As we speak, I am contacting my secret network of Mahjong players across /mjg/ players map; your logs are being traced right now, so you better prepare for the storm.<br>
The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your hand. You're dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can win against you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare flow.<br>
Not only am I extensively trained in tile combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Riichi Book 1, and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable hand off the face of the table. I will rain melds all over you and you will drown in them.<br>
Consider yourself ronned, kiddo.
