    <p>In a recent game, my Mahjong Soul was laid to bare. I ended this game in last place, Adept 3. East 1 as dealer I call Pon on the double Ton, which is also the Dora, and win the hand for an easy dealer Mangan. A few rounds later, 3 of us are about even and one poor lad has fallen to around 12000 points or so. I'm building a nice hand, 1-8 in souzu, non yakuhair pair, with Riichi could even be a haneman. So I declare riichi, waiting on 3 6 9 souzu. 4 x 9s remain, 3 x 6s, and 1 x 3s. I feel I need this ittsu, it belongs to me. The final 3s comes out after the second round of discards. Hmph, noo Ippatsu, no Ittsu. I skip. Knowing that I am just blindly hoping to draw a 9s into hand now, but as soon as I discard I already feel it in my tiny little stupid faggot retarded nigger brain, these little cock sucking neurons start connecting and it's just WHAT THE FUCK AM I DOING WHY THE FUCK WOULD I SIP THAT WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME THIS IS FUCKING RANKED AND I COULD HAVE GUARANTEED FIRST BY A REASONABLE AMOUNT FOR NOW BUT INSTEAD I'M IN FURITEN RIICHI BY CHOICE WHAT AM I? Some more rounds of discards go by. Ron. I deal into last place, Tanyao Toitoi Dora 3, Haneman. Ah, and he's dealer too I can now see. As soon as I deal in, I feel it. A huge relief come off my shoulders. I laugh at the absurdity of my own Mahjong. I reflect quickly on the hand at how ridiculous that play was, but how surefire it seemed at the time. It was here I realised my core flaw. Why I've stayed adept all this time. Not that I have ever really complained about being Adept, but I have wondered why I haven't reached Expert despite playing so long, reading some defence/attack strategy, I'm more than comfortable with 5-block theory and even think about 6 sometimes. It seems that I never really wanted to win... I wanted to win hands, of course! What can beat that feeling of calling on your beloved agari tile? But winning the game is always secondary. And now that I can clearly understand my sickness, I can learn to let it go. I don't have to win every hand, to not try and win the game is to the detriment of not only me but those around me who strive to improve... Everyone wants to earn a victory in which everyone tried their hardest. I can do it. I can win too. It will be difficult, being so reliant on my brand of mahjong... But... I can learn to love myself. I don't have to stick in my old ways! I am no more or less than myself. And I can change for the better. I am worthy of becoming better! I can change! I am worth playing this game!</p>

<p>This is my Mahjong Soul</p>

      <center><h1>Anti-vtuber rant of the Week</h1></center>

  <p>Shut the hell up!</p>

<p>Of course there aren't any new tournaments! Don't go forcing all your work on me, huh? Every time you post in the thread, it's &quot;New tournament doko? New tournament doko?&quot; Like a new tournament can pop out of nowhere! No way! You know more than anyone else that you're asking for the impossible! Don't you, huh?</p>

<p>I know I'm just a cute girl. No matter what people say, I just do as I'm told! But that doesn't mean I don't have any emotions! Don't assume because I'm quiet then I'm really calm. This is from being calm for so long... I'm tired, can't you tell just by looking? You believe I have any sense of duty? You should have seen that I'm nothing but a good for nothing! Don't be fooled by appearances! Get a grip! That's right, I got nothing going for me except being cute! Don't go believing someone like this!</p>

<p>But I'm going to do it, I'm gonna do my job as the substitute TO for you! You're the ones that forced it on me! Rejoice, you idiots!</p>

<p>All right, guys, look at this idea. All of you are moping about past leagues, and wasting precious time you could use ranking. Do you guys realize how pointless all that is? If who you thought was a friend joined the vtuber tournament, that's enough to end the friendship? Is it all over if they post cringe in your thread? You've gotta come to terms at some point, or stuff like this goes on forever! Then it's no good unless you paint over those memories! Overwrite them! Change them into memories of &quot;I couldn't trust anyone because of these weird antics, but we all made up in the end&quot;!</p>

<p>Yeah, you guys are the worst bunch ever! Hypocrites that talk about thread culture and hide your vtuber superchats! Scum of the earth that betray once someone believes you! The lowest forms of life on Earth! But... But there must have been some truth somewhere in there! Maybe there was a bit of truth inside that lie!</p>

<p>Lies! Betrayal! Deception! Hypocrisy! Why don't any of you have a heart big enough to forgive all that! Huh? Since when are you so great that you can cherrypick the people around you? Don't hang out with people based on whether you like them or not!</p>

<p>I hate all of you! But god damn it, you're all my thread friends! So now I announce the Friends Tournament to be done in January 2024. For the gimmick, it's going to be Sanma.</p>
