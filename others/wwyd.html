          <p>I would riichi, because I've never had a double riichi...</p>

          <p>
            Real answer, I would still riichi. It's only E2, Oya is getting carried away a bit but still can be overtaken, and the rest of us are even. <br>
            If I'm right, I think it's confirmed Mangan as it stands? DoubleRiichi, Dora2, tanki wait should round up the fu to 40, I think? Even if not fake mangan is fine. Ura will come because paypig kyara. <br>
            I can't see a reason to throw such a high value hand away this early in the game, on what I would say is a good wait? Tanki terminal <br>
          </p>
          
          <p>What improvements really exist here? I don't see a single improvement that could be made by a single tile, meaning I'd need to draw 2 improvement tiles. Since it's Mahjong, I might not even draw 1.</p>
          
          <p>I would riichi the 1m, waiting on the 1p, since Oya discarded a strong pinzu tile early.</p>
          
          <p>If she goes honitsuu it could be in manzu which makes the 1m slightly harder to come out, and more likely to make others discard pinzu if she is in tenpai. Get Oya off the dealer with a confirmed strong hand.</p>

    <p>For a double riichi? Hell yeah, while it sucks to miss out on the improvement to pure double you'll lose out on the double, the cheeky wait on the 1dot this early feels worth it. Love early riichi's to discourage people. Also I meant missing out on the double riichi</p>

    <p>In my expert opinion I would riichi bcuz its early and you can shut down the others' hands. The wait is a terminal so its likely to come out. The most bestest upgrade if you wait would be ippeiko and its only an extra han while giving the enemies a chance to build up their hands. </p>

    <p>I would definitely discard 1p and riichi this because: 1. The wait is a decent tanki, double riichi can suffer from forcing you into a bad wait, but in this case assuming the others don't beatori it's likely to come out. 2. the value is good as it is, double riichi + 2 red fives, it's at least a mangan, and with those overlapping ryanmen you could get ura 2 for haneman or tsumo and ura one. I don't think chasing for a ippeikou is worth it 3. it's rather awkward to improve as you lack a head. </p>

<p>Why discard 1p and not 1m? Because there are potentially 3 more 4m to be used a suji trap, vs only 2 4p. </p>

<p>With all these points taken into account, I'd rather seize the opportunity given to me rather than wait for potential upgrades that aren't garanteed and let others build their hands free from the pressure of a double riichi.</p>

    <p>I would definitely riichi that without much thought. that's at least mangan and terminal tanki is a good wait considering that it's double riichi, meaning that's it's really early and likely to come out</p>

    <p>people aren't gonna fold a double riichi at least in the beginning so them dropping terminals is likely because it's normal to drop honors and terminals in the beginning.</p>

    <p>Oh, and waiting for improvement isn't very worth it. It's unlikely that you'll get more value if you don't riichi so you're basically waiting for a better wait which I don't think it's worth it considering that you already have mangan with a decent chance to win</p>

    <p>Riichi and drop 1m. You might say nooo my good wait, nooo my improvements, but who cares. That's a mangan+ wait on a terminal, it's good enough for me. Bonus point for this is that dealer 7p is sketchy already, better put your riichi stick on the table to make him rethink.</p>

<p>But for real, just take the rigged hand.</p>

    <p>just riichi. double riichi dora 2 is mangan and terminal tanki is a decent wait. if you try to get a better wait, you can lose value because you won't necessarily get a shape that gives you yaku, and the wait won't be much better.</p>
